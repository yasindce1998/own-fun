DIY English Cricket Word Game (CLI)

## Introduction

I remember playing a fun cricket-inspired word game in school. It involved guessing words based on the first letter, similar to the classic cricket sport we all know and love. 

Now that I'm learning Go, I'm excited to bring this game to life as a text-based (CLI) application. 

## Gameplay

Just like cricket with overs, this game has "overs" where you throw letters instead of balls. For example, a 2-over game means guessing words that start with 12 different letters.

Throwing an "a" means you need to guess a word starting with "a," like "aeroplane" (score: 9 characters). You keep guessing words until the "over" (set of letters) is complete.

This is a great way to test your vocabulary and reflexes!
